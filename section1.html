        For this project, the user will be presented with a map of the U.S., as well as a console with multiple fields to be filled out. The user would need to enter 
data about their yearly income, yearly expenditures, as well as the value of any real estate they own. Since housing prices can vary wildly by geographical region,
there will also be an option to set the real estate value to match the median housing cost of the area. Afterwards, a heatmap would be displayed to indicate which
parts of the U.S. would have the highest tax cost for the user; as well as displaying the gross annual tax cost. Filters could also be applied to only display sales, 
income, or property data.

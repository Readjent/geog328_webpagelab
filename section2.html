        Using geocoding, data regarding the tax rates set by the state, county, and municipality of a given region would be integrated into the map. An additional calculation for

        <button class="accordion">Income Tax Brackets</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Since several jurisdictions implement an income tax that varies by the bracket an individual's income falls into, an additional step would have to be implemented
                to calculate the tax bracket of the user.</p>

            <p>Since a user would likely look at property tax for the sake of planning to buy future property, it would be pertinent to display the median housing cost
                for a given geographical region; which would thus require an additional layer of data to be encoded.</p>
